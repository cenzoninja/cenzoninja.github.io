            <p>
            Traveling to Mars is an amazing experience. Although your body will be induced into a coma, your mind will be semi-conscious and we will project your consciousness into a "Space Bubble", a pleasant garden from which you can look out into space to see the stars going by and in which you will not feel pain or tiredness. <br> <br>
            The whole trip will take five to six years, but your body will not age and your consciousness will be slowed so that you experience it many times faster than it actually occurs, as if you traveled to Mars in a month.

            <p>
            Mars is a beautiful planet. While most of the planet has been terraformed to meet Human living standards, much of it still preserves its wild beauty, with vast deserts, mountains, and crater lakes.
            <br><br>
            For the more intrepid astronauts, there are natural parks where Mars's original state, including toxic atmosphere and low gravity, are preserved with state-of-the-art technology. Please simply enjoy the natural beauty of the parks and respect Mars by refraining from using Omnitools while there!

        <h2 id="Convenient-Marsbase">The Marsbase</h2>
            <p>
            The Marsbase has many comforts, including common areas, luxurious private quarters, and indoor Martian gardens, including the one pictured below.
            </p>

            <p>
            Many types of food are grown in Martian gardens. Human astronauts cite food as one of their main sources of mood-boosts. However, food can be difficult to taste properly in spaceships with zero-gravity and interrupted nose fuction. To solve this, we grow many spicy and crunchy foods, like lettuce and peppers, for Human astronauts to eat while exploring in spaceships.
            <br><br>
            However, one of Mars's most popular foods is the food made famous by the 21st century film <em>The Martian</em>, a story of a Human astronaut left behind on Mars who survives by growing potatoes in a primitive base which he ingeniously adapts for growing food.

        <h2 id="Android-Population">Android Population</h2>
            <p id="Android-Population">
            Mars is the only known planet to have an independent sovereign population of artificial sentient beings. Originally fabricated by Humans, Martian Androids achieved recognized sovereignty through peaceful diplomatic means and today recognize Humanity as a parent species, equal but different.
            <br><br>
            When meeting an Android, please take care to behave in a respectful manner. Many Martian Androids do not take the form of humans; if you are not sure whether what appears to be an animal is an Android or not, just ask it. Androids are aware that not everyone has X-Ray vision and will help you out. Do NOT call an Android "Robot"; that is an offensive term coming from a Human words for "slave".
            <br><br>
            Android culture is calm and logical, focused on family, and slower-changing  than Human culture. Meetings between Humans and Androids can be very enjoyable as long as cultural differences are acknowledged and appreciated!
            </p>
